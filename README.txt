<?php
/**
 * This file contains two classes which represents a bank and its bank accounts.
 * Both classes are very badly implemented following no standards and contains a lot of errors.
 *
 * The Bank class represents a bank
 * The bank have these main features:
 *  - Has zero or more bank accounts
 *  - Must have an address.
 *  - Must have a name
 *  - Can perform a money transfer between accounts in the bank.
 *  - Can return a "Postal Address" created from the name of the bank and the address.
 *
 * The Account class represents a bank account.
 * A bank account has these main features:
 *  - Must have a unique account_number
 *  - Knows its current balance
 *  - Knows its history of transactions (withdrawels and deposits)
 *
 * After the two class implementations three crude tests has been written,
 * which currently all succeed with the current implementation
 *
 * Please refactor classes, interfaces whatever needed and achieve the following:
 *  - Refactored classes should follow PSR-2 coding style guide
 *  - They should be robust and testable
 *  - All errors should be eliminated
 *  - The code should be sufficiently documented
 *
 * You are allowed to do any kind of refactor including renaming classes, function, attributes or
 * introducing breaking changes etc, as long as the three tests continue to work.
 * If needed you are allowed to update the tests as well, if they no longer comply with your refactored code.
 *
 *
 *
 * Have fun :)
